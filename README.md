# Dynamic Mapping

Dynamic mapping and integration is a form of couples counseling in which couples create a map of their relationship dynamic as a tool to identify, heal and improve problem areas of the relationship. The map includes elements from each personâ€™s family of origin, communication styles, conflict areas and reactions, strength, vulnerabilities and goals. Couples collaboratively and compassionately integrate new awarenesses, tools and healthy new pathways to create a happier and peaceful relationship.
