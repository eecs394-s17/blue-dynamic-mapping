# Dynamic Mapping

Dynamic mapping and integration is a form of couples counseling in which couples create a map of their relationship dynamic as a tool to identify, heal and improve problem areas of the relationship. The map includes elements from each personâ€™s family of origin, communication styles, conflict areas and reactions, strength, vulnerabilities and goals. Couples collaboratively and compassionately integrate new awarenesses, tools and healthy new pathways to create a happier and peaceful relationship.

## Known bugs

When you navigate into the "Track Argument" feature, then hit the back button, it takes you to a blank "Home Page"

## Structure of the project

The app has 3 data services

- auth-data.ts connects to firebase and manages authentication
- prompt-service.ts connects to firebase and handles retrieving prompts and storing responses, as well as retrieving response history
- storage-service.ts uses the ionic storage package, which is a file based local storage package to securely store user journals

The functionality of most features should be easy to understand, the one that might benefit from a little explanation is the Track Activity feature.  This feature is implemented on two pages, the prompts-root-page and the prompts-page.  The prompts-root-page is a visually blank component that holds the prompts and responses arrays.  This page then pushes instances of prompt-page populated with data for the current prompt, and gives the pushed page a callback function to call back to prompts-root-page, which will update/add the data there and then push the next prompt-page.
